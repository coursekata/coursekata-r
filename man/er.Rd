Data from: Controlled clinical trial of canine therapy versus usual care to reduce patient
anxiety in the emergency department.
\subsection{Abstract}{
\subsection{Objective}{

Test if therapy dogs can reduce anxiety in emergency department (ED) patients.
}

\subsection{Methods}{

In this controlled clinical trial (NCT03471429), medically stable, adult patients
were approached if the physician believed that the patient had “moderate or greater anxiety.”
Patients were allocated on a 1:1 ratio to either 15 min exposure to a certified therapy dog and
handler (dog), or usual care (control). Patient reported anxiety, pain and depression were
assessed using a 0-10 scale (10=worst). Primary outcome was change in anxiety from baseline (T0)
to 30 min and 90 min after exposure to dog or control (T1 and T2 respectively); secondary
outcomes were pain, depression and frequency of pain medication.
}

\subsection{Results}{

Among 98 patients willing to participate in research, 7 had aversions to dogs, leaving 91 (93\%)
were willing to see a dog; 40 patients were allocated to each group (dog or control). No data
were normally distributed. Median baseline anxiety, pain and depression were similar between
groups. With dog exposure, anxiety decreased significantly from T0 to T1: 6 (IQR 4-9.75) to T1:
2 (0-6) compared with 6 (4-8) to 6 (2.5-8) in controls (P<0.001, for T1, Mann-Whitney U). Dog
exposure was associated with significantly lower anxiety at T2 and a significant overall
treatment effect on two-way repeated measures ANOVA for anxiety, pain and depression. After
exposure, 1/40 in the dog group needed pain medication, versus 7/40 in controls (P=0.056,
Fisher’s).
}

\subsection{Conclusions}{

Exposure to therapy dogs plus handlers significantly reduced anxiety in ED patients.
