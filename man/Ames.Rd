\description{
Data describing all residential home sales in Ames, Iowa from the years 2006â€“2010 as reported by
the Ames City Assessor's Office and compiled by De Cock (2011). Ames is located about 30 miles
north of Des Moines (the stats capitol) and is home to Iowa State University (the largest
university in the state). Each row represents the latest sale of a home (one row per home in the
dataset). Columns represent home features and sale prices (outcome). The original dataset
includes a uniquely detailed (81 features per home) and comprehensive look at the housing market.
The data included here are only a subset used for examples in CourseKata course material. See
the references and data source for the full dataset.
\subsection{Pedagogical Modifications}{

To simplify the dataset for instructional purposes, the data were filtered to include only single
family homes, residential zoning, 1-2 story homes, homes with brick, cinder block, or concrete
foundations, and average to excellent kitchen qualities. Further, the descriptive variables were
reduced to the subset described in the format section.
