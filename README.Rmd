## Overview

*CourseKata Statistics and Data Science*, is an innovative interactive online textbook for teaching introductory statistics and data science in colleges, universities, and high schools. Part of CourseKata’s *Better Book* Project, we are leveraging research and student data to guide continuous improvement of online learning resources. The **coursekata** package is designed to make it easy to install and load the packages, functions, and data used in the book and supplementary materials.

Learn more about CourseKata and its free services and materials at [CourseKata.org](https://coursekata.org/).

This package was inspired by the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) meta-package.


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("coursekata")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("UCLATALL/coursekata")
```


## Usage

`library(coursekata)` will load these core packages: 

```{r}
library(coursekata)
```

* [coursekata_core](https://github.com/UCLATALL/coursekata_core), for various helpers like 
  - `middle()`, `upper()`, and `lower()` to facilitate shading proportions of plots
  - an augmented `print.lm()` which prints the fitted equation as well
  - tools for extracting information from fitted models (`b0()`, `b1()`, `PRE()`, `fVal()`)
  - … and more!
* [supernova](https://github.com/UCLATALL/supernova), for creating ANOVA tables.
* [mosaic](https://projectmosaic.github.io/mosaic/), for a unified interface to most statistical tools.
* [ggformula](https://projectmosaic.github.io/ggformula/), for a formula interface to ggplot2.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.

In addition to useful functions, a great deal of data sets are used by instructors who teach the course. This package installs these:

* [fivethirtyeight and fivethirtyeightdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html)
* [Lock5withR](https://github.com/rpruim/Lock5withR)
* [dslabs](https://github.com/rafalab/dslabs)
* [okcupiddata](https://github.com/rudeboybert/okcupiddata)
