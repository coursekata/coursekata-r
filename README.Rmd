## Overview

*CourseKata Statistics and Data Science*, is an innovative interactive online textbook for teaching introductory statistics and data science in colleges, universities, and high schools. Part of CourseKata’s *Better Book* Project, we are leveraging research and student data to guide continuous improvement of online learning resources. The **coursekata** package is designed to make it easy to install and load the packages, functions, and data used in the book and supplementary materials.

Learn more about CourseKata and its free services and materials at [CourseKata.org](https://coursekata.org/).

This package makes it easy to install and load all packages and functions used in CourseKata courses. It additionally provides a handful of helper functions and augments some generic functions to provide cohesion between the network of packages. This package was inspired by the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) meta-package. 


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("UCLATALL/coursekata-r")
```


## Usage

`library(coursekata)` will load these core packages, including the functions and themes included in this package: 

```{r}
library(coursekata)
```

* [coursekata](https://github.com/UCLATALL/coursekata_core), for various helpers like
  - `middle()`, `upper()`, and `lower()` to facilitate shading proportions of plots
  - tools for extracting information from fitted models (`b0()`, `b1()`, `PRE()`, `fVal()`)
  - an automatically set `ggplot2` theme complete with colorblind-friendly palettes and other improvements to aid perception and clarity of plots. These are loaded by default but can be toggled on and off via `load_coursekata_themes()` and `restore_default_themes()`. The actual plot theme and scale components are also provided for advanced users as `theme_coursekata()` and `scale_discrete_coursekata()` (`viridis` is used for continuous color scales).
* [supernova](https://github.com/UCLATALL/supernova), for 
  - creating ANOVA tables.
  - an augmented `print.lm()` which prints the fitted equation as well
  - … and more!
* [mosaic](https://projectmosaic.github.io/mosaic/), for a unified interface to most statistical tools.
* [ggformula](https://projectmosaic.github.io/ggformula/), for a formula interface to ggplot2.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.

In addition to useful functions, a great deal of data sets are used by instructors who teach the course. This package installs these:

* [fivethirtyeight and fivethirtyeightdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html)
* [Lock5withR](https://github.com/rpruim/Lock5withR)
* [dslabs](https://github.com/rafalab/dslabs)
