## Overview

*CourseKata Statistics and Data Science*, is an innovative interactive online textbook for teaching introductory statistics and data science in colleges, universities, and high schools. Part of CourseKata’s *Better Book* Project, we are leveraging research and student data to guide continuous improvement of online learning resources. The **coursekata** package is designed to make it easy to install and load the packages, functions, and data used in the book and supplementary materials.

Learn more about CourseKata and its free services and materials at [CourseKata.org](https://coursekata.org/).

This package makes it easy to install and load all packages and functions used in CourseKata courses. It additionally provides a handful of helper functions and augments some generic functions to provide cohesion between the network of packages. This package was inspired by the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) meta-package. 


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("UCLATALL/coursekata-r")
```


## Loading Packages Used in CourseKata Courses

`library(coursekata)` will load these core packages in addition to the [functions and theme](#functions-and-theme) included in the `coursekata` package: 

```{r}
library(coursekata)
```

* [supernova](https://github.com/UCLATALL/supernova), for 
  - creating ANOVA tables.
  - tools for extracting information from fitted models (`b0()`, `b1()`, `PRE()`, `fVal()`)
  - an augmented `print.lm()` which prints the fitted equation as well
  - … and more!
* [mosaic](https://projectmosaic.github.io/mosaic/), for a unified interface to most statistical tools.
* [ggformula](https://projectmosaic.github.io/ggformula/), for a formula interface to ggplot2.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.

In addition to useful functions, a great deal of data sets are used by instructors who teach the course. This package installs these:

* [fivethirtyeight and fivethirtyeightdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html)
* [Lock5withR](https://github.com/rpruim/Lock5withR)
* [dslabs](https://github.com/rafalab/dslabs)


## Functions and Theme

This package also comes with a variety of functions useful for teaching statistics and data science, and it has an automatically set `ggplot2` theme complete with colorblind-friendly palettes and other improvements to aid perception and clarity of plots. 

### Estimate Extraction (and Bootstrapping)

Extracting an estimate is as easy as passing a fitted linear model to one of the extraction functions:

```{r single_estimate}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

# the estimate for β₀, the intercept
b0(fit)

# the estimate for β₁, the slope
b1(fit)

# the proportional reduction in error
PRE(fit)

# Fisher's F value
fVal(fit)

# the sum of the squared errors from the model
SSE(fit)

# the sum of squares model/regression
SSM(fit)
```

The estimate extraction functions help to simplify the ability to create bootstrapped sampling distributions of those estimates. Here is an example of bootstrapping the slope:

```{r samp_dist_of_b1}
# use mosaic package to repetitively resample to bootstrap a distribution
samp_dist_of_b1 <- do(1000) * b1(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = resample(mtcars)))

# plot the bootstrapped estimates
gf_histogram(~samp_dist_of_b1$b1)
```

Other estimates and terms can be bootstrapped using the same technique, but you will need to calculate the values yourself. Here's an example of doing that for a term that doesn't have a dedicated extraction function:

```{r samp_dist_of_hp}
samp_dist_of_hp <- do(1000) * {
  # create a new model from the resampled data
  model <- lm(mpg ~ disp * hp, data = resample(mtcars))
  
  # extract the desired estimate, here the coefficient for hp
  coef(model)[["hp"]]
}

# plot the bootstrapped estimates
gf_histogram(~samp_dist_of_hp$result)
```

### Sectioning a Distribution 

When teaching about hypothesis testing, *F*, and *p*-value, it is useful to mark different portions of a distribution as inside or outside the critical zone. `middle()`, `upper()`, and `lower()` each take a distribution of values and return whether the value was in, e.g. the middle 95% of the distribution. Use this with a plotting function to shade in those areas:

```{r shaded_middle}
# shade in the middle 80% of the Thumb distribution
gf_histogram(~Thumb, data = Fingers, fill = ~middle(Thumb, .80))
```

### Toggling the Theme

The `ggplot2` theme is loaded by default but can be toggled on and off via `load_coursekata_themes()` and `restore_default_themes()`. The actual plot theme and scale components are also provided for advanced users as `theme_coursekata()` and `scale_discrete_coursekata()` (`viridis` is used for continuous color scales).
