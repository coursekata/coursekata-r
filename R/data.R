#' Ames, Iowa housing data
#'
#' @description
#' Data describing all residential home sales in Ames, Iowa from the years 2006–2010 as reported by
#' the Ames City Assessor's Office and compiled by De Cock (2011). Ames is located about 30 miles
#' north of Des Moines (the stats capitol) and is home to Iowa State University (the largest
#' university in the state). Each row represents the latest sale of a home (one row per home in the
#' dataset). Columns represent home features and sale prices (outcome). The original dataset
#' includes a uniquely detailed (81 features per home) and comprehensive look at the housing market.
#' The data included here are only a subset used for examples in CourseKata course material. See
#' the references and data source for the full dataset.
#'
#' ### Pedagogical Modifications
#' To simplify the dataset for instructional purposes, the data were filtered to include only single
#' family homes, residential zoning, 1-2 story homes, homes with brick, cinder block, or concrete
#' foundations, and average to excellent kitchen qualities. Further, the descriptive variables were
#' reduced to the subset described in the format section.

#' Emergency room canine therapy
#'
#' @description
#' Data from: Controlled clinical trial of canine therapy versus usual care to reduce patient
#' anxiety in the emergency department.
#'
#' ## Abstract
#'
#' ### Objective
#' Test if therapy dogs can reduce anxiety in emergency department (ED) patients.
#'
#' ### Methods
#' In this controlled clinical trial (NCT03471429), medically stable, adult patients
#' were approached if the physician believed that the patient had “moderate or greater anxiety.”
#' Patients were allocated on a 1:1 ratio to either 15 min exposure to a certified therapy dog and
#' handler (dog), or usual care (control). Patient reported anxiety, pain and depression were
#' assessed using a 0-10 scale (10=worst). Primary outcome was change in anxiety from baseline (T0)
#' to 30 min and 90 min after exposure to dog or control (T1 and T2 respectively); secondary
#' outcomes were pain, depression and frequency of pain medication.
#'
#' ### Results
#' Among 98 patients willing to participate in research, 7 had aversions to dogs, leaving 91 (93%)
#' were willing to see a dog; 40 patients were allocated to each group (dog or control). No data
#' were normally distributed. Median baseline anxiety, pain and depression were similar between
#' groups. With dog exposure, anxiety decreased significantly from T0 to T1: 6 (IQR 4-9.75) to T1:
#' 2 (0-6) compared with 6 (4-8) to 6 (2.5-8) in controls (P<0.001, for T1, Mann-Whitney U). Dog
#' exposure was associated with significantly lower anxiety at T2 and a significant overall
#' treatment effect on two-way repeated measures ANOVA for anxiety, pain and depression. After
#' exposure, 1/40 in the dog group needed pain medication, versus 7/40 in controls (P=0.056,
#' Fisher’s).
#'
#' ### Conclusions
#' Exposure to therapy dogs plus handlers significantly reduced anxiety in ED patients.

#' Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) Data
#'
#' @description
#' Data from: Fundamentals of Biostatistics
#' Notes from: Kahn, M.
#'
#' ## Abstract
#' Sample of 654 youths, aged 3 to 19, in the area of East Boston during middle to late 1970's.
#' Interest concerns the relationship between smoking and FEV. Since the study is necessarily
#' observational, statistical adjustment via regression models clarifies the relationship.
#'
#' ## Pedagogical Notes:
#' This is a versatile dataset that can be used throughout an introductory statistics course as
#' well as an introductory modeling course. It includes many issues from statistical adjustment
#' in observational studies, to subgroup analysis, quadratic regression and analysis of covariance.
